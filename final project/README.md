Final Class Project: Finishing the E-commerce App
-------------------------------------------------
The final 2 weeks of the class are going to be spent on the Final Project, which is to get our Products/Persons/Orders app to a moderately finished state.  If you already have your app working to the Minimum Requirements listed below, you may work on Extra Features, or, if you wish, take on another small project of your own choosing.

All the code we've been working on so far in the "flask example 2" Project is still totally relevant here, and you may use as much or as little of it as you like.  I have provided an enhanced copy of the code in the `code` directory to give you a head-start.


## Minimum Requirements / MVP "Minimum Viable Product" ##
Completion of an E-Commerce App that meets all these requirements will serve as your Final Exam, enabling you to graduate from this class and receive a certification showing that you've learned the basic software development skills needed to create a real-world Web Application.

* Provide a form where the User can enter their Name and other Person Information.  Keep track of this information in the Session so that it persists when the User reloads the page or navigates to another URL.
* Provide a form where the User can enter Product information for a new Product: Product, Category and Price.
* you can "sign in" as a person and add products to your cart
* use an HTML form to say your name & whatever and then you're "logged in"
* use another HTML form to specify a product, product_category and price,
	and it will automatically add it to both the Product table and to an Order that is being kept in the session
* store products & persons in the database
	a place order button which shows an invoice

## Extra Features ##
You may optionally implement 1 or more of these Extra Features in order to further hone your learning and receive additional certification from the School showing that you've gone above and beyond in your studies.

* email the invoice / receipt when order is placed
* instead of you making up your own products, have a product catalog to choose from
* more robust login system: keep track of users / passwords
  can use person class for users, add a password field
  make pending orders persist in the system: can log out and back in
* payment system: e.g. use Braintree, Stripe or PayPal to allow people to purchase the product
* users can log in and view their order history
* make front-end HTML/CSS nice and stylish, make messaging on site / UI / page flow smooth and intuitive


## Other Extra Credit Option: A separate Python Project of your own Choosing ##

If you choose to do a separate project, then as a first step, please send us a description of the project:

* What are you trying to accomplish?  What is the purpose of the program?
* How specifically is the program supposed to behave?
* What is your initial overall plan of how to create the program?  No need for too many details, just an overall description will do.
* What skills that you've already learned in this class are you applying in order to create the program?
* What skills are you "borderline" on, or needing to learn, in order to complete the program?
