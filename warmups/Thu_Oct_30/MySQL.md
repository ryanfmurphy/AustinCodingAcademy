MySQL Fundamentals
==================
>[MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) is "The world's most popular open source database".
It's fast, secure, scalable, ACID compliant and built to handle high intensity web workloads.
The language of MysQL, and most other relational databases, is SQL.
SQL is an expressive language that we will use to ask the database questions about our data.
Our question is known as a query, and the data we get back is called a result set.

***

### Terminology
A database is a collection of tables. A table is a collection of fields that can hold certain kinds of data.
Think of a table as an excel spreadsheet. Each column has a heading, and each row are values for each of those headings.
A table in MySQL has different data types.
Setting the data type and data length on fields will ensure the type data the field can contain.

Here is an example of using ```CREATE TABLE``` to create a new table, if one with the same name doesn't already exist.
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `product` (
  `product_id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `product_name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  `product_description` text,
  `product_price` float(5,2) DEFAULT NULL,
  `category` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  `tags` varchar(100) DEFAULT NULL,
  `date_time_added` datetime DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`product_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8
```

Once we have created a table, we can ```INSERT``` some data into it.
```sql
INSERT INTO `product`
    (product_name, product_description, product_price, category, tags, date_time_added)
VALUES
    ("Nike Shox", "Awesome running shoes", 56.99, "Running Shoes", "shoes, running, footwear", NOW());
```

Lets insert one more product, to keep things interesting.
```sql
INSERT INTO `product`
    (product_name, product_description, product_price, category, tags, date_time_added)
VALUES
    ("Nike Elite Crew", "Really comfortable socks", 7.97, "Athletic Socks", "socks, running, footwear", NOW());
```

Our product table now contains two records that we can retrieve by issuing a ```SELECT```

```sql
SELECT * FROM product;
```

```
+------------+-----------------+--------------------------+---------------+----------------+--------------------------+---------------------+
| product_id | product_name    | product_description      | product_price | category       | tags                     | date_time_added     |
+------------+-----------------+--------------------------+---------------+----------------+--------------------------+---------------------+
|          1 | Nike Shox       | Awesome running shoes    |         56.99 | Running Shoes  | shoes, running, footwear | 2014-10-09 13:07:52 |
|          2 | Nike Elite Crew | Really comfortable socks |          7.97 | Athletic Socks | socks, running, footwear | 2014-10-09 13:23:54 |
+------------+-----------------+--------------------------+---------------+----------------+--------------------------+---------------------+
```

Notice the first field ```product_id```. MySQL automatically assigned an incrementing integer value to this field.
This field is what is known as an auto increment primary key. Every table should contain a primary key, unless you have a really good performance reason to not do so.
A primary key is unique, and is typically automatically generated by the database.
There are some instances where you would want to generate a primary key based on some user criteria.
We will not get into that as it relates to [Sharding](http://www.slideshare.net/mkindahl/mysql-sharding-tools-and-best-practices-for-horizontal-scaling),
which is the practice of horizontally scaling the table out to multiple servers to scale write capacity.

```SELECT``` statements can also filter data using the ```WHERE``` clause.

 Find all products that are in the "Running Shoes" category
 ```sql
 SELECT * FROM product WHERE category = "Running Shoes";
 ```

 Find all products that are cheaper than $60
 ```sql
 SELECT * FROM product WHERE product_price < 60;
 ```

 Find all products that are tagged with "footwear".
 ```sql
 SELECT * FROM product WHERE tags LIKE "%footwear%";
 ```

Find all products that were added on 09/10/2014
```sql
SELECT * FROM product WHERE DATE(date_time_added) = "2014-10-09";
```

Count the number of products we sell
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as num_products FROM product;
```

What is the minimum, maximum and average price of our products.
```sql
SELECT
    MIN(product_price) as min_price,
    MAX(product_price) as max_price,
    AVG(product_price) as avg_price
FROM
    product
```

```
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
| min_price | max_price | avg_price |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
|      7.97 |     56.99 | 32.480001 |
+-----------+-----------+-----------+
```

Create a list of just product names and prices with the $ symbol added to the price. Also sort by product name in ascending order.
```sql
SELECT
    product_name as name,
    CONCAT('$', '', product_price) as price
FROM
    product
ORDER BY
    product_name ASC
```

```
+-----------------+--------+
| name            | price  |
+-----------------+--------+
| Nike Elite Crew | $7.97  |
| Nike Shox       | $56.99 |
+-----------------+--------+
```
