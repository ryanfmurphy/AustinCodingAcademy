Warmup Tue Oct 16 2014
----------------------

We will be taking these classes we've been working on,
and combining them with the functionality that we made
in the 1st Warmup on Thu Oct 9:


Reading From and Writing to the File Format
-------------------------------------------

On Oct 9 we made 2 functions that read from and write to
a file format for the Orders/People/Products:

    https://github.com/ryanfmurphy/AustinCodingAcademy/tree/master/warmups/thu-oct-9-file-format-2-dicts.md


Now we will be taking those functionalities and adding them to this file,
and using them in a way that plays nicely with the classes we've created.

If you have your working solutions from that day, use those!
But if you need to you can use the solutions posted here:

    https://github.com/ryanfmurphy/AustinCodingAcademy/tree/master/warmups/solutions/thu_oct_9_solution.py


1) Import or copy the 2 functions file2dicts() and dicts2file() from
the Oct 9th Warmup into this file.  You may either copy the functions
directly into this file or use an import to gain access to those
functions from within this file.  Create an example file to read the
order data from, and verify that the 2 functions work.


2) Create a function read_order_data_from_file() which uses the
file2dicts() function to read the "orders.txt" file, then takes the
resulting list of dicts and creates any relevant Order(s), Person(s)
and Products(s).

    2a) In your function, create a dictionary called "results" that has
        3 lists in it:

            one called "orders",
            one called "people"
            and one called "products".

        This is where you will build up your result.

    2b) Go through the list of dicts you got from the file2dicts()
        function.

        Every time there is a new Person mentioned, create
        a new Person object and add it to the "people" list.
        If there's already a Person with that name,
        assume it's the same Person and don't make a redundant one.

        Every time there is a new Product mentioned, create a new
        Product object with the corresponding Price.  If that product
        name has already been mentioned, no need to create a new
        object.

        Build up 1 Order object for each Person who buys a Product.
        If a Person buys more than one Product (or the same one
        multiple times) then add all their purchases to the same
        Order.

    2c) Return your finished result from the function, so that you and
        others can call the function and get the corresponding data.


3) Use your read_order_data_from_file() function to create all the
proper Objects, and then print out your results.  What Person objects
did you make?  What Products?  What Orders?  And how are they all
connected together?
