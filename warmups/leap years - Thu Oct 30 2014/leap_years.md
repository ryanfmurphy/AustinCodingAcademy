Which Years are Leap Years?
---------------------------
In the Gregorian calendar 3 criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:

* The year is evenly divisible by 4;
* If the year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless;
* The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
