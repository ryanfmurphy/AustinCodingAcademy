Warmup Tue Oct 14 2014: We will be adding some extra functionality to the
Person / Product / Order classes we created at the end of class on Thursday. 

Add to the Person class:
------------------------

1) Add the bank_balance attribute to the Person class
    (just like we did in the other file oo_person_order_classes.py)

2) Add a function / method called can_afford() which takes a number called
    order_total and returns true or false depending on whether the total is
    greater than the Person's  bank_balance
    (just like we did in the other file oo_person_order_classes.py)

Add to the Order class:
-----------------------

3) Add a function / method called add_product() which takes as
    input an Order and adds it to the listOfProducts
